About and Why
=============

Why A Wire Robot?
-----------------

When one needs to move a tool or a manipulator around, options are limited and have different drawbacks:

- Arms are strong and fast, but have a limited range.
- Wheeled robots have a long range but require either a controlled environment or a way to map an area and plan their route.
- Multicopters have a huge working volume but have a limited strength and can be hard to position and stabilize, especially in outdoor conditions.

A suspended robot can move within a big volume, deploy more strength than a quadcopter and position themselves more easily, depending less on sensors to achieve precision positioning. In several scenarios they are easier to deploy and design than competing approaches. We think that many farming automation tasks can be fulfilled with such a platform.


Why Fae Bot?
------------

Because people who want to move a tool or a manipulator in a 3d volume today have no off-the-shelf solution. They may abandon when confronted with the difficulties of designing a wheeled or flying solution suited for their needs when a wirebot is a cheaper and easier alternative.

The only wirebot systems available on the market right now are big industrial systems that are too expensive for many smaller scale applications or experiments. We propose a simple kit that allows engineers and researchers to quickly set up a reliably moving platform.

We can not possibly imagine all the applications for what is essentially a robot mover. This is why this project is open source and easy to modify. It uses well known parts and documented protocols so that they can be easily modified or replaced to fit new needs.


A Robot Mover
-------------

In the Fae bot, the moving platform is what catches the eye, but the actual body of the robot is in the winch modules. This is the moving part and what allows to place a tool in the work volume. The moving platform is better seen as an interchangeable tool.

A Fae Bot is, in essence, a robot mover. It  brings the tool you want to the place where it needs to be.
